Just a simple repo to run simple classifiers on CIFAR100  

main_train.py grabs a config from configs/ and visualize_weights.py is a simple way to look at all the kernel weights.  
visualize_weights is mainly to see the differnces of running models with different levels of weight decay in the optimizer.

Doesn't do much right now, but an okay repo for something that could use multiple datasets or models.
